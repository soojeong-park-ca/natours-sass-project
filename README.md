## About the Project

### Motivation

Natours is originally designed by Jonas Schmedtmann from his [Advanced CSS and SASS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/). I changed and added extra features / functions to the website for my first ever personal SASS project.

### Tech Framework Used

- HTML
- SASS (SCSS)
- Responsive | Desktop first
- Vanilla JavaScript

### Reflection

This was a first SASS project I built. Since I've always been using CSS3, SASS syntax wasn't too difficult to learn. I enjoyed how structured it was to use SASS. I also enjoyed using mixins and functions which made the code more dry and organized.

The most challening part was to figure out the SASS build process, however, since I've used packages and the json script in the past. It was very intuitive to write the SASS build script and finally turn all the SASS files into a CSS single compact CSS file.

Some new things I learned while building this website/app are:

- Using the modern **`:focus-visible`** pseudo-element to style focus outlines while keeping accessibility in mind
- HTML elements: **`<figure>`** & using it with `float` | `<video>` & `<source>` |
- CSS properties: **`clip-path`** | **`background-clip`** | **`shape-outside`** | **`column-count`**
- CSS functions: **`circle(<shape-radius> at <position>)`** | **`transform: skew()`**

I look forward to using SASS more in the future with my projects!
