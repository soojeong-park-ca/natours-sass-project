## About the Project

### Motivation

Natours is originally designed by Jonas Schmedtmann from his [Advanced CSS and SASS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/). I changed parts of his design and added extra features to the website for my first ever personal SASS project.

### Tech Framework Used

- HTML
- SASS (SCSS)
- Vanilla JavaScript

### Reflection

This was a fun and exciting app to create especially because I had to build everything from scratch. I learned a lot while I was creating multiple React components and using data across the components to make the app work. Working with props was the main way I accomplished moving data from one component to another.

One of the challenges I ran into was making the score system work. It required me to decide the logic for choosing and unchoosing the option from each question so that I could update the individual and overall score of the quiz depending on the choices a user might make.

Some new things I learned while building this website/app are:

- Using the modern **`:focus-visible`** pseudo-element to style focus outlines while keeping accessibility in mind
- HTML elements: **`<figure>`** & using it with `float` | `<video>` & `<source>` |
- CSS properties: **`clip-path`** | **`background-clip`** | **`transform: skew()`** | **`shape-outside`** | **`something-else`**
- CSS functions: **`circle(<shape-radius> at <position>)`** |

I look forward to ...
